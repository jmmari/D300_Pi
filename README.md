# D300_Pi

These codes allow to easily use the LDROBOT D300 LiDar with a Raspberry Pi.

It uses the linux sdk from LDROBOTS: https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_stl_sdk/tree/master

Unzip the sdk in the same folder. The current build is for RP4. If you want to use it on another Pi, 
re-build using command "./auto_build.sh"

You have bash scripts and python scripts to start with.
